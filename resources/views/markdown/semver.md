## Definition 
Semver versioning is a type of {{linkToPost('versioning')}}  that tracks major and minor changes as well as fixes using the format `Major.Minor.Patch` eg: `1.0.0`.

## Use Cases and Examples
Semver versioning provides a lot more information. For example, by just looking at two version numbers one can tell if different versions of a software are compatible with each other. 

- The **Major** number is increased when the change made in the software makes it widely different from the previous version and might result in major changes from the end-user as well.
- When the changes made result in a change that is subtle and not too different from the previous version the **Minor** part is increased by a number up.
- And the **Patch** number is increased when the changes made are meant to fix components that should have already have worked.
