## Definition 
Pixel tracking is an approach where an image file is sent by a service provider with the intention of collecting information about the recipient.  

## Use Cases and Examples
Pixel tracking is prevalent in the world of digital advertisement. 
It is mostly used in situations where a service provider has limited access to an end user's device or software tool. 

An example of such a situation is the ability to track who opens an email. There are limited opportunities to collect this kind of information so the sender of an email will usually attach a small image that might not be visible to the email, and when the reader's email client attempts to load up that image it forwards their details to the email sender.

## Summary
There are many ethical problems with this approach, and many services provide ways to combat its use.
