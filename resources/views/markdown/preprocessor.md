## Definition
A preprocessor is any type of system that processes and most times alter data before its being passed onto another system for further processing. 

## Use Cases and Examples.
Preprocessors are commonly associated with the C and C++ programming language as many modern programming languages do not come with this built-in. 

Another common use is to add special constructs or syntax to an existing language then use a preprocessor to convert this to something its intended {{linkToPost('interpreter')}} or {{linkToPost('compiler')}} can understand.

 A good example of this is [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) which is a tool that introduces useful CSS syntax to increase developer productivity. It later converts all that syntax down to existing CSS syntax. 

## Summary
There is a very thin line between preprocessors and {{linkToPost('transpilers')}} though. The former is used to refer to altering data and the latter is used to refer to the conversion of one language to the other.
