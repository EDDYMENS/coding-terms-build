## Definition

A programming language is a language much like English but a bit strict used to convey instructions to a computer. If a calculator is a computer, then mathematical notation is the programming language used to convey instructions to the calculator.

Several programming languages exist today, and each language has its own structure/format/{{linkToPost('syntax')}} that the programmer needs to be aware of to communicate with the computing device.

## Use Cases and Examples

Some examples of programming languages and their specific use cases are:
- Python is a well-known programming language widely used in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI).
- HTML5, PHP, and Javascript are popular web-programming languages.
- SQL is used for working with {{linkToPost('databases', 'database')}}.

## Summary

In other to convert this written language to instructions you will typically use either a {{linkToPost('compiler')}} or an {{linkToPost('interpreter')}}.
