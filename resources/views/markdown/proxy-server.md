## Definition 
Proxy servers are {{linkToPost('server')}} setups that serve as a mediator for all web requests. They receive these requests and may do something with them before sending the request over to its intended server.

## Use Cases and Examples
Proxy servers can be used for many different things. 

For example a proxy server is the backbone of a {{linkToPost('VPN', 'virtual private network vpn')}} service. The proxy server gets the request made by the user then forwards it to the intended provider, as far as trackers are aware the traffic is being sent to and from the proxy server and can't tell where it was really sent to.

There are other use cases such as preventing ad blockers from blocking ad content and for {{linkToPost('load balancing')}} among other things.
