## Definition

ASCII stands for **American Standard Code for Information Interchange**, a set of chosen numbers used to represent letters, numbers, and unique actions.

## Use cases and Examples

`065` is the number used to represent `A`. 

The question then is why and for what reason do we need this mapping?

Well, computers store data using an `on` and `off` state like a light bulb. We managed to find a way to represent this as a number but that's using `1` and `0`, respectively. 

 If we wanted to store `A` what would be the approach? The easiest answer is to represent it using a number since that's all we can store with the computer (more or less). But we have way more than two alphabets so `0` and `1` is not enough. But if you pair more `0` and `1`s together, for example, `01000001`, you can store all the alphabets. And since we can convert binary numbers to decimal numbers, we can convert `01000001` to `065`. This decimal is what is known as ASCII. 

## Summary
This number-to-character mapping allows computers to interpret the information stored as binary back to readable text.
