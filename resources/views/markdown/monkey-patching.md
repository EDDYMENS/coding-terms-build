## Definition

Monkey patching involves overriding the default functionality of code with another during execution ie: ({{linkToPost('runtime')}}).

## Use Cases and Examples

```
//output before override
console.log("hello"); // hello

//overriding default action
console.log = function(input) {
    return "Output is: "+input;
}

//output after override
console.log("hello") // Output is: hello
```

The above Javascript code shows the output of the `console.log` function before and after its monkey patched, with an extra string (`Output is:`) attached to the output after its patched.

## Summary
There are a few good use cases for monkey patching in programming, for example, we can mute all `console.log` outputs when in {{linkToPost('production')}} by just patching it up. There are however many instances where monkey patching can lead to code that is hard to work with.

Monkey patching could mean overriding well-known functionalities which could lead to confusion among co-developers and potential {{linkToPost('bugs', 'bug')}} in your code.

If you ever think of monkey patching there is a chance something wasn't done right in your code, to begin with.
