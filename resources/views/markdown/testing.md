## Definition
Software testing is not too far from its general meaning.
Testing software means checking that parts of it work as they should

## Use cases and Examples
In software development, there are many and different types of testing. 
Some of which includes:

- **Acceptance testing:** This is the process of testing feature sets end users interact with to be sure they meet the intended specifications.

- **Unit testing:** This is the kind of testing done to ensure many small components of the software work as intended. 

- **Regression testing:** This type of test examines if any part of the software fails as a result of a new change.

- **Stress testing:** One way to determine whether a software system is ready for extra or unexpected loads is to stress test it.

## Summary
Most software teams don't apply all types of software testing. Usually, teams pick a few depending on their needs.
