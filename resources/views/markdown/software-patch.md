## Definition

A software patch is a fix to a software issue or {{linkToPost('bug')}}.

## Use Cases and Examples

Sometimes after a software release, it might not work as intended and a fix will need to be released to *patch* up the problem.

For web applications, this patch can be seen immediately after a refresh. For other applications such as desktop apps, you might need to download the latest version to get the fix.

## Summary
Every software team needs to have a fix or update plan, as this will come in handy should anything go wrong after launch. 

Also, having a good quality assurance team helps reduce the number of things that could go wrong with an application after release.
