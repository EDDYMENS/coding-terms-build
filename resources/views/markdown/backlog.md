## Definition

A backlog is a set of tasks that need to be completed to get a completed project. It is a prioritized list of work for the developers to work on next once their current tasks are completed. The prioritized list means the tasks or items are listed based on their priority level so that the team knows what is the most urgent thing to focus on next. 

## Use Cases and Examples

In the present fast-paced and agile environment, developers or technical teams are under great pressure to deliver new applications or features based on customer demands. So, to remain productive and address the demands effectively, product backlog plays a key role.

For example, a software team can sit together with business owners to set up a prioritized list of tasks (backlog). With an accurate backlog, the team can move swiftly. So, even if one task gets canceled or put on hold, the team can work on the next lined-up task and continue its activities.

## Summary

A glimpse of the backlog empowers a team to have a prior preview of what is coming next. So, the team can start thinking about how to address the next list of tasks. In addition, they can also address any dependencies, conflicts, or work needed in advance. In short, backlog helps the team to be more productive and time-efficient in accomplishing tasks.
