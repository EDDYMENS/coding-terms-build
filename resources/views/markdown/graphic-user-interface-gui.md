## Definition
The graphic-user interface refers to all the visual elements you interact with when using most {{linkToPost('software')}} today.

## Use cases and Examples
The search bar and buttons you find on [Google](https://www.google.com/) to the table-like structure you see when using Microsoft Excel are perfect examples of a graphical user interface.

## Summary
It wasn't always the case that most software we use today came with graphical user interfaces. In the past, you could only interact with most software applications using the {{linkToPost('command line interface', 'command-line-interface-cli')}}, which involved passing in your instructions to the computer in the form of text.
