## Definition
Source code is the collection of code or a string of text files that make up a program.

A program is a set of instructions and statements produced by a programmer in a {{linkToPost('computer programming language', 'programming language')}}. Another program called a {{linkToPost('compiler')}} or {{linkToPost('interpreter')}} then converts this code into something the computer better understands called {{linkToPost('machine language')}}.

To write source code. Programmers can use a text editor, a visual programming tool, or an {{linkToPost('integrated development environment (IDE)', 'integrated development environment')}}.

## Use cases and Examples

```Here is an example of the source code for a Hello World program in C language:
/* Hello World program */
#include<stdio.h>
main ()
{
print ("Hello World");
}
```

Above is an example of a source code in the C programming language and this is a simple program it's meant to output the words `Hello World.` on the screen. 
For bigger and more complex programs the source code usually spans multiple lines and or multiple files.

## Summary
Source code is one of the core parts of a program a programmer works on. It includes declarations, instructions, {{linkToPost('functions', 'function')}}, {{linkToPost('loops', 'loop')}}, and other statements that might be particular to the programming language in use.
