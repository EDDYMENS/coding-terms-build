## Definition

When you take a look at mathematical formulas most of them usually have alphabets say **x** or **y** in them, and the intention is that anyone using these formulas will replace the **x** and **y**s with actual values. In the programming world functions can be viewed as these formulas and parameters will be the **x** and **y**s.


## Use Cases and Examples

Here is an example of a function in Javascript that adds two parameters together:

```
// declaring the function
function adder(a, b) {
    return a+b;
}

// using the function
adder(1,2);
```

What you have above is a function called **adder** that takes two parameters and returns the sum of `a` and `b`. The last bit of the {{linkToPost('code')}} shows how you will use this function. 
You will refer to the values you pass in to replace the parameters as {{linkToPost('arguments', 'argument')}}.

## Summary

Parameters are key to how we end up getting different behaviors out of the same piece of code.
