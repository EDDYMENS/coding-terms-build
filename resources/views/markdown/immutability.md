## Definition
Immutability is a programming concept where all or some data stores provided by the {{linkToPost('programming language')}} limit the developer's ability to modify the data once created.

This concept might be extended to other constructs beyond data storage. 


## Use Cases and Examples
The major argument for introducing immutability in a software project is to ensure that such stores are not changed unexpectedly by other parts of the program. This increases the certainty within the software application.

## Summary
Immutability in itself is a concept, and there are many libraries out there to help incorporate this concept into existing programming languages.
