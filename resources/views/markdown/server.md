## Definition
A server is a computer connected to the internet and has the proper software setup to return data in the form of a website, image music, etc., whenever a user requests it.

Whenever you enter a website URL and a page is returned to you. It's a server somewhere preparing and sending that page back to you.

## Use Cases and Examples
The software that interprets the request a user sends is also known as a server. So it's used to refer to both the hardware and software. 
Popular examples of server software include [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org) and [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com).

Instead of setting up and managing their servers, developers and companies can purchase, rent or pay a subscription to hosting companies to access server resources.
Popular choices include [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com), [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com) [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).

**Cloud Offering:** This is similar to the concept of renting a server but engulfs the renting and accessing of not only servers but every resource needed to run and distribute software. 
## Summary
Servers are the backend bone when it comes to modern software distribution.
