## Definition
Cloud computing is a term used to describe the theoretical availability of endless computing resources.

## Use Cases and Examples
In the past, companies had to purchase and maintain computing resources, to anticipate their usage down the line.

This could be a hit or miss if they have enough resources already purchased when they need it or if there are too many resources they do not need.

## Summary
In practice, cloud computing providers take it upon themselves to stack up endless computing resources and by issuing them to a large customer base they never go to waste, and hence is a win-win business model for both companies and the cloud providers.
