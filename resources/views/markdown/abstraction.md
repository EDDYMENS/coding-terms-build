## Definition
In general terms, the word **abstraction** means leaving out or hiding the details of something, mostly to help one to better understand the matter at hand without getting stuck in the details.

The use of this word in programming is not too far off from the general definition. Programmers usually use the word to describe having to make sure third parties working with their code or systems don't have to care too much about unnecessary details.

## Use cases and Examples
There is a lot that happens when it comes to payment gatway systems. When they take payment details from the apps we are working on, a lot of processing is done by the gateway itself some of that is then forward to the acquiring bank who then does some processing of its own sorting out the transaction for the customer then returning the response to our app.

But mostly programmers integrating these payment gateways don't have to think too much about  all that. Most of it is abstracted away and the programmer is left with very little to deal with to integrate these  payment gateways into their apps.

## Summary
Abstraction happens at different levels of computing from logic gates, compilers to the code itself. 

It greatly helps programmers to focus on newer problems instead of every bolt and nut of their software or the hardware they are working with.
