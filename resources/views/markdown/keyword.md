# Definition

Keywords are words that have a predefined  meaning in a programming language. Keywords are reserved words that developers or programmers cannot use as the name of something for example {{linkToPost('variables', 'variable')}}, {{linkToPost('constants', 'constant')}} and {{linkToPost('functions', 'function')}} in most {{linkToPost('programming languages', 'programming language')}}.

Basically any part of the {{linkToPost('syntax')}} where the developer has the option to use any name they choose must not clash with the reserved words of that language. They convey a specific instruction and so using it as a name of something in your code might lead to confusion during compile time.

## Use Cases and Examples

For example, some of the keywords in the C programming language include: 
- **int:** Highlights that the variable will hold an integer value.
- **long:** Highlights that the variable will hold a large integer value.
- **break:** Used to immediately terminate any {{linkToPost('loop')}} or {{linkToPost('iteration')}}.
- **if:** Allows the program to enter the specific code section once certain conditions are met.

All the above keywords are frequently used by programmers while writing C {{linkToPost('code')}}. Keywords can be different between programming languages but many languages share common keywords like `if`.

## Summary

Keywords in a programming language is usually the key things that help a {{linkToPost('compiler')}} or {{linkToPost('interpreter')}} break down code into an {{linkToPost('abstract syntax tree')}} to further convert  the code into instructions the computer can execute.
