## Definition
Authorization is the process of checking if a user of a software has access to a particular resource. 

## Use Cases and Examples
Users of an app might have different access rights to different parts of the app. For example, some users might have admin rights which might include being able to edit and delete data. 

Authorization rights are usually stored in the {{linkToPost('database')}} and often can be edited by other administrators through a {{linkToPost('GUI interface', 'graphic-user-interface-gui')}}

## Summary
There is also {{linkToPost('authentication')}} which is the process of verifying if a user has access to an application in the first place.
