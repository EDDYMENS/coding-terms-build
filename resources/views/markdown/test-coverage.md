## Definition
Test coverage refers to how much of your software is tested in percentage.

## Use cases and Examples
If a team doesn't check test coverage, they might believe their software has been thoroughly tested, even though this may not be the case.

The way some systems measure test coverage is to simply count how much of your {{linkToPost('source code')}} is executed when the test is run thus **`code coverage = <lines_of_code_executed> / <total_lines_of_code> X 100`**

## Summary
There are several tools out there you can integrate into your test suite to measure the test coverage, depending on your needs.
