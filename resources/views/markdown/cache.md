## Definition

A cache is a storage component (both in software and hardware form) that makes it easy for the computer to recall data faster because the computation is done earlier. While limited in memory, cache data is storage that records the data to reduce loading time in case the user wants to access the data again in the future. 

## User Cases and Examples

Different forms of cache exist today, each with its specific use case. Some of them are listed as follows:

- **Browser Cache:** As the name suggests, the data that the browser stores, to make future visits to the same webpage faster, is termed browser cache.
- **Memory Cache:** It's the kind of cache where an application stores data in the memory of a computer as opposed to the storage disk because memory is a lot faster mostly in terms of data retrieval compared to disk storage.

## Summary

In essence, a cache is meant to make frequently accessed data readily available for use.
