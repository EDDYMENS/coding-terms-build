## Definition
In software development, boilerplate code is code with many placeholders that you can replace with your code or data.

## Use cases and Examples
Boilerplates come in different forms depending on the type of software.
In web development, for instance, boilerplate code might provide you with a folder structure as well as authentication code to get started with.

Some tools allow the developer to pass some parameters regarding the type of boilerplate they will need and its generated.

## Summary
If you are a developer and find yourself repeating the same tasks with every new project, there is a good chance a boilerplate already exists for that. If not, it might be worth creating one.
