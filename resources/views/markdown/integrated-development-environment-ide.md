## Definition

An **Integrated Development Environment(IDE)** is a term used to describe a code editor that comes with a host of tools that makes working on a particular codebase a lot more easier and efficient.

## Use Cases and Examples

For many types of software development out there a basic code editor might be enough to do the job.

For some software projects such as the development of an IOS app, a basic code editor might not be sufficient. 

[X Code](https://developer.apple.com/xcode) which is the primary IDE for developing IOS apps provides a host of tools to make the development a lot more efficient. For example, it comes with an app previewer/emulator so that you can see what the app will look like as you go along.  This is also true for [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) for Android app development.


## Summary

Some code editors like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), now provide a host of tools in the form of plugins and can be said to be a lot more an IDE than a code editor in this case.
